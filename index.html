									<h2>Data Cleaning with SQL -- <a href="https://github.com/rjwCode/SQL_Data_Cleaning" class="">GitHub</a></h2>
									<hr>
								</header>
								
								<p>
									In this project, I utilized an Excel dataset with information about various properties. In the image below, you can see
									what the original uncleaned dataset looked like.<br>
									<br><div class="project_image"><a href="images/original_dataset.png" target="_blank"><figure><img src="images/original_dataset.png" alt="original dataset before cleaning"><figcaption>Fig. 1. Original Dataset</figcaption></figure></a></div>
									<br>The initial step of my data cleaning process was to observe the data to find what adjustments needed to be made. Various qualities
									of the data jumped out to me, such as the PropertyAddress field, which could be better analyzed if separated into multiple columns. Other observations included
									the presence of various NULL values, the formatting for DATE fields, formatting for the SoldAsVacant field, and duplicate data. 
									<br><br><hr>
									<p style="font-size: 24px; margin: 0;">Step 1: Modify DATE Formatting</p><hr>
									<br>In this step, the SaleDate column was modified to be a DATE field, rather than a DATETIME.
									The SQL Code for this step is displayed in <i>figure 2</i>.
									<br><div class="project_image"><a href="images\data_cleaning_sql_step_1.png" target="_blank"><figure><img src="images\data_cleaning_sql_step_1.png" alt="Modifying the SaleDate column to a DATE field"><figcaption>Fig. 2. Setting SaleData as a DATE Field</figcaption></figure></a></div>
									<br><br><hr>
									<p style="font-size: 24px; margin: 0;">Step 2: Populate NULL Values in PropertyAddress</p><hr>
									<br>In addition to NULL values, I observed that this column contained consecutive rows for the same property.
									Thus, to solve the presence of NULL values, I utilized the address value from the next row for the same property
									to replace them. This can be observed in the SQL code shown in <i>figure 3</i>.
									<br><div class="project_image"><a href="images\data_cleaning_sql_step_2.png" target="_blank"><figure><img src="images\data_cleaning_sql_step_2.png" alt="Replacing NULL PropertyAddress values"><figcaption>Fig. 3. Replacing NULL PropertyAddress Values</figcaption></figure></a></div>
									<br><br><hr>
									<p style="font-size: 24px; margin: 0;">Step 3: Splitting PropertyAddress Into Address and City</p>
									<hr>
									<br>After handling NULL values for the PropertyAddress field, the data now should be modified further for ease
									of analysis. In order to do this, PropertyAddress was split into two new columns, PropertySplitAddress and PropertyCity.
									This process is demonstrated in <i>figure 4</i>.
									<br><div class="project_image"><a href="images\data_cleaning_sql_step_3.png" target="_blank"><figure><img src="images\data_cleaning_sql_step_3.png" alt="Splitting PropertyAddress into PropertySplitAddress and PropertyCity"><figcaption>Fig. 4. Splitting PropertyAddress into Address and City</figcaption></figure></a></div>
									<br><br><hr>
									<p style="font-size: 24px; margin: 0;">Step 4: Splitting OwnerAddress into the Address, City, and State</p>
									<hr>
									<br>The OwnerAddress column is also in need of some refactoring. In this case, the OwnerAddress column was split into three columns: OwnerSplitAddress, OwnerCity, and OwnerState.
									The SQL code used for this is displayed in <i>figure 5</i>. 
									<br><div class="project_image"><a href="images\data_cleaning_sql_step_4.png" target="_blank"><figure><img src="images\data_cleaning_sql_step_4.png" alt="Splitting OwnerAddress into OwnerSplitAddress, OwnerCity, and OwnerState"><figcaption>Fig. 5. Splitting OwnerAddress into Address, City, and State</figcaption></figure></a></div>
									<br><br><hr>
									<p style="font-size: 24px; margin: 0;">Step 5: Reformat SoldAsVacant Values</p>
									<hr>
									<br>Moving on from splitting columns, I observed that the values for SoldAsVacant initially had four variants: 'Y', 'Yes', 'N', and 'No'. To make the values for this column more neatly organized, the values 'Y' and 'N' will be reformatted to 'Yes' and 'No'
									respectively. This process is displayed in <i>figure 6</i>. 
									<br><div class="project_image"><a href="images\data_cleaning_sql_step_5.png" target="_blank"><figure><img src="images\data_cleaning_sql_step_5.png" alt="Reformatting SoldAsVacant values to 'Yes' and 'No'"><figcaption>Fig. 6. Reformatting SoldAsVacant Values</figcaption></figure></a></div>
									<br><br><hr>
									<p style="font-size: 24px; margin: 0;">Step 6: Removing Duplicate Values</p>
									<hr>
									<br>In this step, duplicate values in the dataset will be handled. The method chosen for this process was to utilize ROW_NUMBER() and partitions to find rows with duplicate values for specific fields. This process
									is demonstrated in <i>figure 7</i>
									<br><div class="project_image"><a href="images\data_cleaning_sql_step_6.png" target="_blank"><figure><img src="images\data_cleaning_sql_step_6.png" alt="Removing Duplicates"><figcaption>Fig. 7. Removing Duplicate Values</figcaption></figure></a></div>
									<br><br><hr>
									<p style="font-size: 24px; margin: 0;">Step 7: Whitespace Removal</p>
									<hr>
									<br>After handling duplicate values, the next step taken was to handle possible whitespace in various fields. As shown in <i>figure 8</i>, the chosen method to handle whitespcae was TRIM().
									<br><div class="project_image"><a href="images\data_cleaning_sql_step_7.png" target="_blank"><figure><img src="images\data_cleaning_sql_step_7.png" alt="Removing Whitespace"><figcaption>Fig. 8. Removing Whitespace</figcaption></figure></a></div>
									<br><br><hr>
									<p style="font-size: 24px; margin: 0;">Step 8: Value Formatting</p>
									<hr>
									<br>Next, to ensure that the formatting is clear and consistent for the OwnerCity and PropertyCity fields, they will be set to upper case. This was done using the UPPER() function, with the SQL code displayed in <i>figure 9</i>.
									<br><div class="project_image"><a href="images\data_cleaning_sql_step_8.png" target="_blank"><figure><img src="images\data_cleaning_sql_step_8.png" alt="Upper Case Formatting"><figcaption>Fig. 9. Upper Case Formatting</figcaption></figure></a></div>
									<br><br><hr>
									<p style="font-size: 24px; margin: 0;">Step 9: Handling Rows with Many NULL Values</p>
									<hr>
									<br>Within the dataset, it was also observed that various records had NULL values for the same columns. In order to make the data easier to analyze, rows that met this criterion were removed. The original rows with many NULL values are shown in 
									<i>figure 10</i>, and the process used to remove them is displayed in <i>figure 11</i>. 
									<br><div class="project_image"><a href="images\data_cleaning_sql_step_9_1.png" target="_blank"><figure><img src="images\data_cleaning_sql_step_9_1.png" alt="Rows with Many NULLs"><figcaption>Fig. 10. Rows with Many NULL Values</figcaption></figure></a></div>
									<br><div class="project_image"><a href="images\data_cleaning_sql_step_9_2.png" target="_blank"><figure><img src="images\data_cleaning_sql_step_9_2.png" alt="Removing Rows with Many NULLs"><figcaption>Fig. 11. Removing Rows with Many NULL Values</figcaption></figure></a></div>
									<br><br><hr>
									<p style="font-size: 24px; margin: 0;">Step 10: Removing Non-essential Columns</p>
									<hr>
									<br>Additionally, some columns within this dataset were deemed to be non-essential for any analysis processes. These columns (OwnerAddress, TaxDistrict, and PropertyAddress) were removed, as displayed in 
									<i>figure 12</i>. 
									<br><div class="project_image"><a href="images\data_cleaning_sql_step_10.png" target="_blank"><figure><img src="images\data_cleaning_sql_step_10.png" alt="Removing Non-essential Columns"><figcaption>Fig. 12. Removing Non-essential Columns</figcaption></figure></a></div>
									<br><br><hr>
									<p style="font-size: 24px; margin: 0;">Step 11: Creating a Backup Table for Cleaned Data</p>
									<hr>
									<br>Finally, after completing all of the previous data cleaning processes, a backup table was created to store the now cleaned data. This was accomplished through the use of the INTO clause in SQL, as demonstrated in <i>figure 13</i>. 
									<br><div class="project_image"><a href="images\data_cleaning_sql_step_11.png" target="_blank"><figure><img src="images\data_cleaning_sql_step_11.png" alt="Creating a Backup Table for Cleaned Data"><figcaption>Fig. 13. Creating a Table for Cleaned Data</figcaption></figure></a></div>

									<p style="font-size: 24px; margin: 0;">Part 1: Defining Project Goals and Understanding the Data</p>
									<hr><br>
									For this project, I utilized an Excel dataset containing answers from a survey on professionals in careers related to data analysis. Microsoft Power BI was used to 
									clean, transform, and visualize this data. The goal of this project was to answer the following questions about the data:<br><br> <ul><li>Is work/life happiness related to salary?</li><li>What were the
									most popular programming languages amongst participants?</li><li>How does salary vary based on job title?</li></ul> In order to work towards answering these questions, the dataset must first be observed
									and understood. A snippet of the original dataset is shown in <i>figure 1</i>. 
									<br><div class="project_image"><a href="images\original_data_powerbi.png" target="_blank"><figure><img src="images\original_data_powerbi.png" alt="Original Dataset Snippet"><figcaption>Fig. 1. Original Survey Dataset</figcaption></figure></a></div>
									<br><hr>
									<p style="font-size: 24px; margin: 0;">Part 2: Data Cleaning and Transformation</p>
									<hr><br>After taking a look at the data, various aspects of it stood out that needed to be modified. The first of these was a number of completely empty columns, which were removed.
									These empty columns are shown in <i>figure 2</i>. The next modification was to handle certain columns which had an answer option of "other". This category
									was generalized into one "option" category, in order to group the various text entries together. This generalization was performed by splitting the column
									between "other" and the rest of the text entered by the participant. This split column was then removed from the dataset. This process is displayed
									in <i>figure 3</i>. Also, some columns that were deemed unneccessary for analysis, such as an email column (which only held the value "anonymous"), were
									removed. It was also observed that many rows in the dataset did not have a value for the "Highest Level of Education" field. These rows were removed from the
									dataset. The last data cleaning step that was taken had to do with the "Current Yearly Salary" field. Originally, this was a range of salary values. The average
									was taken from this range, and moved to a new column labeled "Salary". This new column was then multiplied to show the full salary value, as opposed to showing
									the value in thousands.
									<br><div class="project_image"><a href="images\powerbi_project1_step1_1.png" target="_blank"><figure><img src="images\powerbi_project1_step1_1.png" alt="Empty Columns"><figcaption>Fig. 2. Empty Columns</figcaption></figure></a></div>
									<br><div class="project_image"><a href="images\powerbi_project1_step2.png" target="_blank"><figure><img src="images\powerbi_project1_step2.png" alt="Splitting Columns"><figcaption>Fig. 3. Splitting Columns</figcaption></figure></a></div>
									<br><hr>
									<p style="font-size: 24px; margin: 0;">Part 3: Data Visualization</p>
									<hr><br>Now that the data has been cleaned, the next step was to visualize it in the report view of Power BI. Three card visuals were used to display the number of survey participants, the average
									participant age, and the Pearson Correlation Coefficient between work/life happiness and salary. The correlation coefficient is discussed in detail in part 4 of this write-up.
									Additionally, two gauge visuals were used to display the average rating for salary and work/life balance. A clustered bar chart was used to depict the average salary by job title. For further
									categorization of data, a pie chart was created to show the favorite programming languages, and a treemap was created to show the participants by country. A scatter plot was created
									to show the relationship between salary and the score given to work/life balance. A histogram was also created which shows the participant count for various salary bins. The full report is displayed in <i>figure 4</i>.
									<br><div class="project_image"><a href="images\powerbi_project1_report.png" target="_blank"><figure><img src="images\powerbi_project1_report.png" alt="Power BI Report"><figcaption>Fig. 4. Power BI Report</figcaption></figure></a></div>
									<br><hr>
									<p style="font-size: 24px; margin: 0;">Part 4: Data Analysis</p>
									<hr>
									<br>After visualizing the data, these visualizations were used to create insights that help to answer the originally posed questions about the dataset.
									The first question to answer has to do with the relationship between salary and the work/life balance score. Using the scatter plot and correlation coefficient, it was determined
									that there was a weak positive relationship between these two fields. This determination is backed up by the trend line of the scatter plot, and the coefficient of 0.25. 
									Although there is a relationship between these fields, it is not one that has a strong effect on either. The next question to answer has to do with programming languages. The top two
									programming langauges among participants were Python and R. This makes sense, as these are the most popular languages for data analysis. The final question relates to variation of salary
									by job title. Looking at the report, it appears that most of the included job titles stayed around the $60k mark, with some outliers being data scientist, database developer, and student.
									This has been my process of cleaning, transforming, visualizing, and analyzing data.
